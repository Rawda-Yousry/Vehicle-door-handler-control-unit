# Vehicle door handler control unit 
The Vehicle Door Handle Control Unit is a project that implements a system for controlling vehicle door handles with an anti-theft locking capability. The system consists of the following components:

* **Microcontroller Unit:** The core unit responsible for controlling the door handle functions and interacting with the peripherals.

* **Push Buttons:** Two push buttons are used to simulate the handle lock/unlock button and the door lock/unlock button.

* **LEDs:** Three LEDs are used to simulate the vehicle lock, hazard lights, and vehicle ambient light.

The system operates with the following considerations:

* All push buttons are connected as active low.

* All LEDs are connected as active high.
